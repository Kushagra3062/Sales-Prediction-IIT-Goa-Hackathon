Sales Prediction Model

This repository contains a Machine Learning model developed for the Sales Prediction problem, as part of the IIT Goa Hackathon. The model is designed to predict sales based on various features using advanced data preprocessing and predictive modeling techniques.

📌 Features

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values using forward and backward fill.

Merging datasets (train with oil prices).

OneHotEncoding for categorical variables.

Standardization using StandardScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing total sales by product family.

Analyzing oil price vs. sales correlation.

Pie chart for family distribution.

Time series analysis of sales and oil prices.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Implementation of XGBoost for predictive modeling.

Performance assessment using RMSE, MAE, and R² scores.
